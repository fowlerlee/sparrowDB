// Schedule(DiskRequest r) : Schedules a request for the DiskManager to execute. The DiskRequest struct specifies whether the request is for
// a read or write, where the data should be read from / written into, and the page ID for the operation. The DiskRequest also includes a std::promise whose
// value should be set to true once the request is processed. See below for more information about std::promise.
//
// StartWorkerThread() : The startup method for the background worker thread which processes the scheduled requests. The worker thread is created in the
// DiskScheduler constructor and calls this method. This worker thread is responsible for receiving queued requests and dispatching them to the DiskManager.
// Remember to set the value correctly on the DiskRequest's callback to signal to the request issuer that the request has been completed.
// This should not return until the DiskScheduler's destructor is called.
